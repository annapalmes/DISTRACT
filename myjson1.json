With his mustache, his yellow jacket and his unmistakable voice, the leader of Queen is an icon for a generation, who danced his catchy melodies and mourned his death in 1991.But who was Freddie? What is your story? In this illustrated biography, Alfonso Casas accompanies Freddie Mercury from Tanzania, where he was born, to the United Kingdom, where he died and became immortal singing Show Must Go On. His charisma on stage, his impressive vocal range and his iconic looks broke with the classic model of rock star, making it clear that a person can go out of the established and even then - or precisely for that reason - continue to triumph.
